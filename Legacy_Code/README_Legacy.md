README Legacy Code

This folder contains legacy code that was used to create the databases and intermediate functions from APIâ€™s that helped create the functions in All_Helper.py and Main_Function.py

I have removed API keys in this code for security purposes - thus, parts of this code will fail if run.

We are including this code so hat we may show parts of our though process and the techniques employed in helping build our overall final functions.

I have attempted to keep as much of the code intact as possible - there may be minor parts missing that have been omitted - e.g. if I needed to make a quick minor change to a database file, and then deleted the code responsible for that minor change.

API keys for these files will be provided upon request.
